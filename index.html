                My name is Jose Gavilanes.  I was born and raised in New Jersey.  I have many interests from writing, skateboarding, video editing, video games, web development and so much more.
                The phrase "jack of all trades master of none" has been used to describe me from time to time.  I have a background in marketing and before the bootcamp the last time
                I touched coding was in highschool.  I have always had an interest in coding whether it was designing a website or developing an app the fact that I could make something my own from
                the ground up always appealed to me.
